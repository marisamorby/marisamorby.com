How quickly shadows grow

As the light becomes long

And time becomes short

And our insecurities

Melt into the darkness

Forgotten

In the absence of light

We cannot remember

Why we feared death

Or shied from rejection

Or worried about

Mundane daily tasks

The shadows are

Enveloping

Washing over everything

Flooding our memory

When there is only darkness left

It is sure to be silent

A final breath of peace

At long last

When the light is long

And the shadows have finally

Reached our faces
