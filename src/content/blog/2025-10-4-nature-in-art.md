I’ve mentioned before about how I think art has the power to [inspire us](https://marisamorby.com/can-art-give-us-hope/) and help us find beauty and hope when we need it most. I believe that art keeps us going. It makes us connect, think, cry, laugh. Art makes us feel, and feeling helps us heal and move forward. So today I want to share a few artists whose work captures the joy and beauty of nature.

[Kateryna Kryvolap](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO3hFUZke59/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) is a Ukranian-Canadian artist who practices the traditional Ukranian artform of Petrykivka.

[Sable Rae](https://www.instagram.com/artbysablerae/) is a Portland-based artist that manages to capture the moody beauty that is so uniquely Pacific Northwest.

[Claire Elliot](https://www.instagram.com/onegrandgallery/p/DO1f4njkiP0/) focuses on botanical art with a beautiful play of light and is also based in Portland, Oregon.

[Rachel Altschuler](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOEFTJ-DUzx/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MTZnODk5anBzZDlxcg==)is from Pennsylvania, and my favorite thing about her work is the personality that she manages to capture in every bird she paints. I have no idea how she does it, but they each have their own little personality that she’s so wonderful at highlighting.
