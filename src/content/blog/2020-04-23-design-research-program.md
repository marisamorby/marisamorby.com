## So what's this post all about then?

  
I've had the opportunity in my career to work with some fantastic researchers, designers, and product managers. In these roles I've been able to create research programs where there wasn't one before.  
  
Companies have been investing more in customer insights and research for a few years now, but with teams sometimes remaining small, or, like right now, not growing at all because of what's happening with COVID-19, we're all trying to learn how to do more with less.   
  
So if you're a research team of one, I'm here for you. Let's talk about how you can continue to get your company great insights when it's just you at the wheel. 

### Some Disclaimers

Research goes through cycles just like any other product lifecycle. Your program will change and grow as your team, tools, and customers change and grow.  
  
Since this is a long list, I'll be updating it as I have time. If you'd like to see something discussed that isn't mentioned here, send me an email at me@marisamorby.com.



## **Creating a framework**

### Identify your philosophy

* What function does research serve at your company?



## Identify your process

* How will reasearch interact and serve other teams at the company?
* How will research interact with the customers and people you serve?



## **Measuring success**

###   
Identify metrics

* How will you measure the success of research at a company level?
* How will you measure the success of research for your users?
* How will you measure the success of research for your team?

###   
Identify process

* What tools are you going to use to reach out to customers and users?
* How will you encourage and incentivize participants?
* How will you involve other team members in the process and findings?
* How will you ensure actionable insights are shared?  
  


## Figure out scale

* How many people are on your team?
* How can you leverage your team to get more research?
