  Designing for people: How research and design can help us create smarter cities

If you live in a city, look around you. What do you hear? What do you see? How do you feel? 

Chances are, if you're living in the USA, you hear cars, you see traffic, and there's a low hum of anxiety as the sound of the world rises around you. But it doesn't have to be like this. If we stop, think, and ask better questions, we can design cities that are better. Better for us as humans, better for the environment, and better for the wildlife that has made cities their home, too.

Check out the presentation and learn how our current inability to design holistically for cities has created a place built for cars, and not for peopleâ€”and how we, as a community, can start to shift that focus back to people.
