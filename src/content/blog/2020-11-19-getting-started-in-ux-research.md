Last year a friend mentioned that his fianc√© was interested in getting into UX Research, although that hadn't been her first career path. "Could I offer any advice," he asked, "since this wasn't my first career either?"

I wrote up a quick guide on what worked for me, and resources I used. Since I first started in UX Research several years ago, I've gone from a UX Researcher to a Product Manager and am currently a Senior Design Researcher at Netlify. The linked post covers how I first got started in UX Research and will hopefully be helpful for those just getting started.

It's still a Google Doc, because I'm a terrible person who keeps my writing in like 5 different places (save me from myself), but it's got links and some (hopefully) helpful things to get you started. 

Check out my (not comprehensive) guide on [Getting Started in UX Research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bmSkvjM-0OvoLfhVQx3iniC6ax30iV9cqhgpO3rLMTc/edit?usp=sharing)
