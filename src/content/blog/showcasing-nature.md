A few years ago I read a book about Alexander von Humboldt, called [_The Invention of Nature_](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduzwgpz7vt8ukgrz9flhnpk9wkk/l2hehmh3lql975s6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG93ZWxscy5jb20vYm9vay90aGUtaW52ZW50aW9uLW9mLW5hdHVyZS05NzgwMzQ1ODA2Mjkx) by Andrea Wulf. Von Humboldt was the one of the first researchers who studied what we now call ecology, and someone that many of the first ecologists, like Charles Darwin, looked up to.  
​  
His approach to nature matches mine, and I found his work fascinating.  
​  
In addition to finding wonder and curiosity in the interconnectedness of nature, he was diligent about collecting works from artists, writers, scientists, and travelers that detailed the nature they saw around them.  
​  
He ultimately compiled and released [_Cosmos: A Sketch of a Physical Description of the Universe_](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qduzwgpz7vt8ukgrz9flhnpk9wkk/m2h7h5h8323pzghm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG93ZWxscy5jb20vYm9vay9jb3Ntb3MtOTc4MDgwMTg1NTAyMw==). He had plans for 8 volumes but died mid-way through the 5th.  
​  
When I see all the modern ways we're able to create and share our explorations of nature, it makes me think of Alexander von Humboldt. In a way, we're creating our own _Cosmos_ in front of us and each of us can be collectors, artists, and creators.  
​  
I've been especially interested in how photography connects us with nature in new ways; showing us glimpses of the world that we haven't seen before or maybe just missed.

This photo in particular is fascinating to me.

And a few of my own photos that personally make me feel connected with nature. All of these are what I consider "small photos". They are pictures of small things that we walk by every day that we just don't notice. But when we stop and look there's a lot of beauty packed in to these very small spaces.
