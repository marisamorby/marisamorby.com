  Taking back the streets
description: >
  Streets were originally meant for all people to use. With the rise of the car, people got pushed further to the edges, and an entire legal system was set up to defend drivers of cars rather than those impacted by them. How can we change that narrative now?

Now that some type of physical distancing will probably be the norm until we have a better treatment for COVID-19 or a vaccine, how are we going to all go back to living our lives? One of the best things I think we can do is opening up our streets so that restaurants and shops can keep patrons healthy through physical distancing, while minimizing the economic impact by keeping business open.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll go back to the &quot;normal&quot; we had before. We must make spaces safer for people. I hope local businesses and communities push for street closures so restaurants and shops can set up on the street in open air so people can have the space they need to stay healthy.</p>&mdash; Marisa Morby (@marisamorby) <a href="https://twitter.com/marisamorby/status/1253365117917392898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 23, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

  
We're starting to see more and more cities realize that this is a good direction to go in. 



New York is about to open it's streets to restaurants

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Leave sidewalk space for pedestrians and put restaurant and cafe seating in parking spaces, please. <a href="https://t.co/pzi98YVCYN">https://t.co/pzi98YVCYN</a></p>&mdash; Doug Gordon (@BrooklynSpoke) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrooklynSpoke/status/1255176233014497281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Vilnius, Lithuania is doing the same

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius, has announced plans to turn the city into a vast open-air cafe by giving over much of its public space to hard-hit bar &amp; restaurant owners so they can put their tables outdoors &amp; still observe <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/physicaldistancing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#physicaldistancing</a> rules.” <a href="https://t.co/YPNUikQwZu">https://t.co/YPNUikQwZu</a></p>&mdash; Brent Toderian (@BrentToderian) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrentToderian/status/1255145859999653888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

These are both great examples of using restrictions to think creatively to redesign what we're used to. Steps like this can change our baseline and give us the opportunity to redefine what normal is.   
  
As we keep moving forward into an unkown future we will need to do the work of making the changes that will allow us to work and live together while keeping each other as safe as possible.
