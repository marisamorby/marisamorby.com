Tonight the sky is dark  
And the clouds congregate angrily

But I see you always  
On a sun-filled day  
With blurred edges like an old photo  
Squinting through your smile  
And loving the camera  
I see you in front of our table  
Filled with breakfast pastries  
All of which we will finish  
Along with two cups of tea

Then I open my eyes  
And see the night  
Holding tightly to the last bit of earth  
Refusing to give way  
I see the clouds  
Hardened on the edges  
And full of contempt  
I close my eyes

And we are sailing through the water  
Hiking on a moon-filled trail  
Dancing and laughing and  
Making so much noise  
That people canâ€™t help  
But laugh along with us

I open my eyes  
To rain falling softly  
Smelling so strongly of earth and life  
That I begin to fear  
The death of hope inside of me  
I close my eyes

And I can almost see  
Your lovely features  
The color of your skin  
The wonderful smell that lingers  
On your pillow  
Your pale blue eyes  
Or perhaps green, or brown  
That smile  
Even when your mouth does not  
Your pale skin  
Or perhaps your dark tan  
I can almost see you  
But then again  
Maybe not

I open my eyes  
To a room filled with bright  
Incandescent light  
I close my eyes

And you are  
Holding me  
Loving me  
Wanting me for all that I am

I open my eyes  
And you are always

One  
Touch  
Away
