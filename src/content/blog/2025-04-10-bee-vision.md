# How we see the world
I'm fascinated with the idea that when presented with the world around us, we literally see things completely differently. Philosophically it reminds me that this is what makes a shared reality so hard. We're each looking at the world and seeing something a little differently than another. I recently went to the [Saatchi Gallery](https://www.saatchigallery.com/) in London, and they had a whole exhibit on flowers in contemporary art. One image that caught my eye, and made me want to write this article, was this. It's a UV image of an iris, an exploration on how a bee might see a flower.

And later I saw this book _What the Bees See: A Honeybee's Eye View of the World_ by Craig Burrows, and was fascinated. A bee looks at the same flower that we do, and sees something entirely different. 

# How color works with our eyes
In a previous newsletter, I've talked about [how color works](https://marisamorby.kit.com/posts/design-nature-reimagined-how-color-works). But how does an eye perceive color? Animals that can see color have photoreceptors in their eyes; rods and cones. Rods allow us to perceive light and periphery vision and cones allow us to perceive different color waves. In humans, we have three cones that can perceive red, blue, and green. Every color we perceive is a single color or combination of more than one color.

With our 3 cones humans are able to see up to [10 million colors!](https://www.allaboutvision.com/eye-care/eye-anatomy/color-vision/). 

Bees have compound eyes made up of individual omatidia. Scientists currently think that bees see in a pixelated way, with a higher resolution image the more omatidia they have. Bees can also see polarized light, creating a band running across the sky like a stripe,90 degrees from the sun. Bees use this polarity to navigate. They can also see color, but their visible range is yellow, blue, green, violet, and ultraviolet. Because their visible color range is shorter, but they can see ultraviolet light, the world looks very different than what we see.

Science is also emerging suggesting that pattern plays a huge part in how a bee finds flowers, and that they can differentiate different flowers by their patterns, even from far away. Due to the nature of their eyes, bees can't see a sharp image of what's in front of them until they get really close.

Additionally, some flowers likely have UV reflective areas on their petals, to help "guide" the bee to the pollen by creating a very obvious center, almost like a bulls-eye.

# What a bee sees
Based on what we currently know, this is what scientists think bees see when looking at specific flowers. You'll notice that the pattern is distinguishable even when the image is still pixelated.

You'll also see that the color is represented differently in the "regular" photo vs the UV image. The colors above are likely not the colors that the bee sees, but these images help us understand the patterns and pixelation.

For a better grasp of the colors they see, we need to look again at Craig Burrows work. Here, he shows that a flower that looks white to us likely looks violet to a bee.

And here on the left, a simple, but beautiful yellow flower to us, almost glows when seen by a bee.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hs3vAZYsA8) is also really fascinating and explains how insects see and how a bee might see the world, and how their eye size, shape, and placement help them see almost like they were looking through a fisheye lens.
