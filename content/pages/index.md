My resume says I work with data, but what I’m _really_ good at is understanding people. Data tells us what’s happening — people tell us stories.

Stories drive everything in our lives, from our worldview to our communication, from our friendships to our purchasing decisions.

By combining the stories from real people with the larger trends gathered by analytics, **I help companies discover the real problems their customers are facing.** By gathering the right data early on, **I save companies thousands of hours of wasted time and effort** chasing the wrong solutions. By testing solutions quickly and cost-effectively, **I find and plug the leaks inf your funnel to bring in millions of extra dollars.**

Whether you’re developing a brand new product from scratch or optimizing conversion in your existing funnel, **I provide battle-tested strategies for minimizing risk and overhead while maximizing your revenue.**
