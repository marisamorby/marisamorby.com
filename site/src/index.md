# Hey there, I'm Marisa.
I’m a Sr. Design Researcher at [Netlify](https://netlify.com) where I talk with developers about how we can improve their workflow. I write [Design & Nature Reimagined](https://marisamorby.com/nature-and-climate-change/), a weekly(ish) newsletter about the intersection between design, nature, and tech. I enjoy spending time on projects that make us kinder as people, healthier as a planet, and happier with ourselves. When I’m not working, you’ll find me in my garden, at my pottery wheel [making ceramics](https://marisamorby.com/shop/).


## Join my newsletter: Design & Nature Reimagined

Every week(ish) I'll compile articles at the intersection of design, nature, and tech to help us imagine a better relationship with nature as we address the climate crisis.
