# Web projects
Sometimes I make little projects on the web. Check them out!

## Restaurant Picker
On the final day of our last day on earth, you will find Jason and I arguing about where to eat. Because I'm a true genius and force for good, I made a restaurant picker so we never have to fight about food again. (Note: we still fight about it all the time)

## Wet Bulb Calculator 
We've seen global heat waves the last few years that are becoming increasingly more intense. I put together a wet bulb calculator that can help you decide how much time is safe to spend outdoors, based on relative humidity and ambient temperature.
