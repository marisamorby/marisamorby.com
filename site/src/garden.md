# Learn about native plants
I garden a lot, and now I'm in the process of transiting the majority of my yard to native plants. [Read about why native plants matter](https://marisamorby.com/native-planting-intro/), and see my [curated plant list](https://marisamorby.notion.site/Native-PPL-List-f4ff4d951f5d494eb3ecc505325b7e97).
